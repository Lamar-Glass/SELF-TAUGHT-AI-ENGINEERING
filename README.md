# 🧠 My Self-Taught AI Journey

Hi, I'm Lamar Glass. This repository is where I document my journey to becoming an AI engineer by teaching myself. I started this on August 1, 2025.

## 🎯 My Goal

To learn Artificial Intelligence and become skilled in both the science and engineering of AI — from Python basics to building and deploying machine learning systems.

## 📅 Timeline

I'm following an 18-month learning plan that covers:

- Python programming
- Math for AI (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- Deep Learning (TensorFlow and PyTorch)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Model Deployment (Docker, FastAPI, AWS)

## 🗂️ What’s in this Repo

- `notes/`: My study notes
- `projects/`: My hands-on coding projects
- `checkpoints.md`: My weekly progress updates

## ✅ My Progress

| Month | Topic | Status |
|-------|---------------------------|--------|
| 1     | Python Basics             | In progress |
| 2     | Math for AI               | In progress |
| 3     | Data Structures & Algos   | Coming up |
| ...   | Machine Learning & beyond | Soon |

## 📌 Why This Repo?

To track my learning, stay accountable, and build a portfolio to show what I’ve learned. I’ll also post projects and code here as I go.

Thanks for visiting!
