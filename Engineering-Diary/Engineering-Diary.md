### üîß What I Did Today:
- Completed [**1st exercise.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/1st%20exercise.py) ‚Äî Practiced basic Python syntax and `print()` statements.  
- Completed [**2nd exercise.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/2nd%20exercise.py) ‚Äî Learned about variables and performed basic arithmetic.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:

- [**string method.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/string%20method.py) ‚Äî Used `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`.  
- [**type casting.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/type%20casting.py) ‚Äî Converted between `str`, `int`, `float`.  
- [**variables.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/variables.py) ‚Äî Reinforced naming conventions and scope.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:
- Remembering zero-based indexing in Python.  
- Type errors when combining numbers with strings.

### üí° How I Handled It:
- Visualized string indices on scratch paper.  
- Checked types using `type()` to validate before operations.

### üìà Things to Work On:
- Animate a small program combining string manipulation with casting logic.

### üîß What I Did Today:
- [**6th exercise.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/6th%20exercise.py) ‚Äî Continued with strings and casting.  
- [**7th exercise.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/7th%20exercise.py) ‚Äî Combined variables, inputs, and operations.  
- [**8th exercise.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/8th%20exercise.py) ‚Äî Built an interactive user input program.  
- [**user input.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/user%20input.py) ‚Äî Processed data from users.  
- [**countdown timer.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/countdown%20timer.py) ‚Äî Implemented countdown using `while` loop and `time.sleep()`.  
- [**while loops.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/while%20loops.py) ‚Äî Wrote loops running until a condition was met.  
- [**for loops.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/for%20loops.py) ‚Äî Iterated through sequences.  
- [**nested loop.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/nested%20loop.py) ‚Äî Built multi-level loops for patterns.  
- [**logical operators.py**](https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/SELF-TAUGHT-AI-ENGINEERING/blob/main/logical%20operators.py) ‚Äî Practiced `and`, `or`, `not`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:
- Avoiding infinite loops due to improper exit conditions.  
- Clarifying the difference between `and` / `or` logic.

### üí° How I Handled It:
