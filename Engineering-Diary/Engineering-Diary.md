### 🔧 What I Did Today:
- I finally got a machine for my studies..not the best, but something. It’s an old HP laptop: 4GB RAM, Intel Core i3, 300GB HDD. It's noisy and the battery barely lasts an hour, but it's my starter rig.
- Booted into Windows 8 just long enough to grab Arch Linux. I wiped everything and installed Arch with Hyprland. It's lightweight, perfect for this machine.
- Spent time learning basic Linux commands and got familiar with bash.
- Set up my folder structure based on my AI timetable..everything feels more organized now.
- Wrote my first Python script: `hello-earth.py`. It’s a small start, but it’s mine.

### ⚠️ Challenges:
- Some tools just won’t install..this laptop struggles under pressure.
- It crashes when I try running anything too heavy.

### 💡 How I Handled It:
- I worked within the limits of what this machine can handle..it’s a test of patience.
- Started saving slowly for a better setup. Maybe someone will buy me a coffee and support the grind.

### 📈 Things to Work On:
- Writing cleaner code.
- Planning for better hardware.

### 🔧 What I Did Today:
- Started exploring my AI learning path..mostly through YouTube tutorials and free online content.
- Revisited and tweaked my self-taught timetable. AI is moving fast, and I want to stay relevant.
- Tried finding real research papers, but struggled with access.

### ⚠️ Challenges:
- New tools and concepts feel overwhelming.
- Imposter syndrome hit hard today..that voice that says I’m not good enough.
- Couldn’t find reliable academic resources for AI research.

### 💡 How I Handled It:
- Took time to research the tools and tried not to rush understanding.
- Reminded myself: even the best once doubted themselves. Pushed forward anyway.

### 📈 Things to Work On:
- Staying focused (distractions are real).
- Becoming better at online searching and maybe learning web scraping.
