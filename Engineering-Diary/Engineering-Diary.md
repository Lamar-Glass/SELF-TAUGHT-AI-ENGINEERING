# Engineering Diary

## Date: 01-08-2025

### What I Worked On:
- I had to get a computer for my studies, i wasn't that lucky but i managed to find an old HP laptop with a wide screen, specs: 4Gb of ram, intel core i3, 300Gb of hdd storage. It breaths loudly and drains battery in less that an hour. I booted in windows 8 to download arch linux, made arch the only os with hyprland and some other dotfiles. This saved me alot of resources.
- I had my work machine prepared for my self-taught ai engineering, installed some of the neccessary tools needed for preparation, and also learned some basic bash command and linux commands.
- Made a folder with all the neccessary file and folder directories following my time-table's file breakdown.
- i coded my first python file "hello-earth".
  
### Challenges Faced:
- Some of the important tools couldn't install due to machine limitations, my machine was too low in specs requirements.
- crashes when i force heavry workloads.
  
### Solutions:
- Stayed behind he hardware limitaions to avoid crashes.
- Saving up coin by coin for a better desktop set up, i hope warm hearted people would donate and buy me coffee.
  
### Things to Improve:
- Code optimization.
- Better rig.
